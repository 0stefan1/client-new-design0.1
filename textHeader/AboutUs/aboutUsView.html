            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>Startup founded in 2016 in Petrosani, Romania by Swiss Integrated Services in partnership with Jiu Valley Sensor Ventures. Since its founding, Check4Green has been recognized for its potential through participations at Startup competitions such as How To Web 2016.</p>
            <p>Petrosani is a city in Hunedoara County, Romania. Its name comes from the "Pietros" word in Romanian which means "stony, rocky". </p>
            <p>The city of Petrosani was founded in the 17th century (around 1640) and developed rapidly. In 1720, an Austrian cartographer mentions that the entire Jiu Valley was intensely populated and settlements could be seen from one end to the other. The inhabitants were shepherds and farmers. </p>
            <p>Around 1840 mining activities began taking place in Petrosani due to the opening of its coal mine, quickly followed by a boom in population and development. </p>
            <p>In 1848 The University of Petrosani was built with the intent of increasing the level of education in the area but it soon became a pillar of higher education for both Romanians as well as other nationalities, attracting new foreign students each year. After the fall of the communist regime, the mines activities ceased to be the primary occupational field for the municipality as the economy diversified.</p>
            <p>A boom of small businesses emerged and the area began placing its focus on tourism, education and electronics manufacturing. Today, the city's advances in technology can be seen by the number of companies working in the field as well as the number of business ideas born at the University of Petrosani which are then materialized by companies through strategic partnerships. </p>
            <p>Check4Green works with the latest technologies currently available on the marketplace, our products and services focusing on the Internet of Things sector and LoRA networking. This year, we are implementing the first LoRA network in Hunedoara County, Romania.</p>
