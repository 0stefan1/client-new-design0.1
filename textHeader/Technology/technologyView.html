            <h1>TECHNOLOGY</h1>
            <p>Our products and services are based on LoRA technology to help provide top class solutions, compatible with the latest trends in the IoT field.</p>
            <p>We can also customize our products to fit the requirements of companies working with 3G, LTE and LPWAN technologies such as SIGFOX, LoRA and NB-IOT.</p>
            
            <b>LoRA technology advantages</b>
            <div class="container-p-technology">
                <p>- Usage of 868 MHz/ 915 MHz ISM bands which is available world wide.</p>
                <p>- Wide coverage range: about 5 km in urban areas and 15 km in suburban areas</p>
                <p>- Longer battery life due to less power consumption</p>
                <p>- Single LoRa Gateway device is designed to take care of 1000s of end devices or nodes</p>
                <p>- Easy to deploy due to its simple architecture</p>
                <p>- It uses Adaptive Data Rate technique to vary output data rate/Rf output of end devices</p>
                <p>- Widely used for M2M/IoT applications</p>
                <p>- The physical layer uses robust CSS (Chirp Spread Spectrum) modulation</p>
                <p>- Supports three different types of devices: class-A, class-B and class-C</p>

            <b>How it works</b>
            <p>1. Customer chooses the type of products/service they need. Our team is here for you in this stage to help analyze and determine the implementation requirements for your company.</p>
            <p>2. Products are delivered and customer can create an account for sensor management at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.check4green.com/" title="Go to check4green.com">www.check4green.com</a>.</p>
            <p>3. After placing the sensors in the desired locations, the customer logs in the platform to customize the sensors and validate them.</p>
            <p>4. From this point on, the customer can remotely monitor the sensors, set action rules based on sensors reading, customize notifications and more.</p>
